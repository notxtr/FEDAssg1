# FED Assignment 1
In this assignment, I am creating the front end of a website for a fictional band known as Kessoku Band
 
## Design Process
 
This website is aimed for individuals who enjoy music, anime, and also the fans of Kessoku Band. Hopefully, this website can achieve in helping users who want to conveniently buy concert tickets for Kessoku band online, as well as a merchandise section where users can smoothly purchase goods related to the Kessoku Band, ranging from keychains to CDs.

## Features
In this website, It has features where you can book concert tickets, buy merchandise, and view information about each of the members of Kessoku Band.

In the booking concert tickets section, users would have to choose one destination in a fixed date, then they can choose the number of tickets they would like to buy.
 
In the Merchandise section, they can select one product to view, and read all of its details.

To return to the homepage, users would have to click on the Kessoku Band logo on the top left of the screen.
