                    <p>
                        Hitori is an extremely introverted first year student of high school, often referred by her bandmates as Bocchi-chan. With high social anxiety, making it very difficult for her to talk to strangers. She often tries to avoid interactions, even performing her first live house show from inside a cardboard mango box. Because of her introversion, she rarely goes outside and instead spends most of her time at home, playing the guitar alone in a dark closet.
                        <br><br>
                        She seeks praise from others, likely as a reaction to her personality. She started playing the guitar to become a music star for the sole reason of being admired. She sometimes attempts to socialize, often in unusual ways, such as mimicking how others talk. However, these attempts often fail.

                    <p>
                        A bright and popular first year of high school. She is in charge of the guitar and vocals of Kessoku Band. She is a cheerful character who likes to interact with people and can talk to her with a smile without hesitation, even when she meets her for the first time. She looks up to Ryo, and her feelings can go too far.
                    
                        <br><br>
                        While living a daily life that felt fun but mediocre, when she saw Ryo at a concert performance on the street of the band she used to belong to, she admired her, saying, "I'm jealous of walking on an unusual road." Although she applied as a guitarist to add to the initial members of Kessoku Band, she escaped from the band just before her first concert because she couldn't play the guitar. She later reconciled herself by reuniting with Ryo and revealing her truth. When Hitori persuaded her, she joined Kessoku Band again.
                        <br><br>
                        Although she has little experience in playing and is technically immature, as a result of practicing under the guidance of Hitori at the school festival concert, she showed that she had grown up to connect time with ad-lib for Hitori who had a problem with the equipment.

                    <p>
                        Nijika is a kind, sweet and friendly girl. She is outgoing, yet also very accommodating and makes others feel at ease. She was exposed to band culture at an early age due to the influence of her older sister, Seika, who was once in a band and is now the manager of a live house, and is familiar with the music industry .
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Nijika is selfless by nature and does her best to support others. Indeed, not only does she work at "STARRY" out of gratitude towards her older sister, but she also holds the group together and alongside Kita, helps Hitori overcome her social anxiety. She also makes an effort to keep her best friend, Ryo Yamada in check whenever she's up to no good.
                        <br><br>
                        She is good at designing, and produces the logo for Kessoku Band as well as their CD covers. She also edits the video footage of concerts to post online.

                    <p>
                        A cool and solitary second-year high school student. She is the bassist of Kessoku Band and Nijika's best friend. Her hobbies are out of the ordinary, and she rejoices when called a weirdo. She lives with a wealthy family but never has any money because she spends it all on instruments. She occasionally eats weeds to get rid of her hunger.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite her expressionless exterior, Ryo is an eccentric girl with a mischievous sense of humor, coming across as a person who likes to mess with others. She's fairly tactless and is happy to be called a weirdo. She is quiet and has few friends, but unlike Bocchi, prefers to spend time alone. She has a tendency to make up excuses to get out of social activities, but Nijika sees through them every time. Despite her reserved nature, Ryo enjoys showing off her bass playing skills whenever possible.
                        <br><br>
                        Ryo has encyclopedic knowledge about her interests and becomes very talkative about them when given the opportunity. Ryo is shown to be an inconsistent student and temporarily forgets her musical knowledge when she studies for upcoming exams. She also has very strong opinions on how bands should present themselves, and encourages Bocchi to write genuine lyrics for Kessoku Band's material.
